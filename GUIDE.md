Download the zip file  extrect to desktop . open the redist_ folder and run INSTALL LIBRARIES.bat . Make sure u have Python installed and put to correct PATH
after installation of libraries are done CLICK on RUN me before password encryption.py . this will create a secret .key wich will contain ur encrypted passes
Open passsword_encryption , encode ur passes wich will be saved in secret.key
to get ur passes , change secret.key to secret.txt and copy ur encrypted passes. Dont forget to change it back to secret.key back after u copied ur passes
Open the app and decrypt ur passes
We reccomend to save ur password_encryption.py and run me before....py in a zip file with the secret . txt file and make the zip pass locked
